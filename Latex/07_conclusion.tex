\chapter{Conclusion}
This thesis tries to give a short insight into a large and widely ranged topic of comparing trees.

First we give some basic notations and definitions since the language varies greatly between different papers and authors. 

The first idea of comparing trees is the tree edit distance. Editing one tree into the other, by using simple operations such as deleting, inserting and relabelling step by step, is one intuitive way of comparing trees. Every operation is associated with some costs. The task is to find a sequence of editing operations of minimal costs, that alters both trees to become the same. There are simple algorithms using a dynamic programming approach that can compute the tree edit distance to optimality. We start with Shasha and Zhang~\cite{SasAndZha}, who used a trivial decomposition strategy which guides an iterative, recursive algorithm which always compares the rightmost subtrees. Then we present the algorithm of Klein~\cite{Kle} and the algorithm of Demaine et al.~\cite{Dem}. These algorithms involve more sophisticated decomposition strategies which take into account the sizes of the investigated subtrees. Demaine et al. provided a lower bound on the running time for computing the tree edit distance with a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore they proved that their algorithm satisfies this bound, making it optimal among all algorithms with a dynamic programming approach. 

Moreover in chapter $4$ we proceed with the so called flexible tree matching. Here the idea is that one may relax the restrictions of ancestry and sibling groups. Instead of forbidding such violations we just have to pay a fine for any occurrence. Unfortunately finding the flexible tree edit distance is a strongly $\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem. Nevertheless we present a model for approximation heuristics. Kumar et al.~\cite{Kum} provided a Monte Carlo algorithm to compute an approximation of the flexible tree matching.

In chapter $5$ we take a look at a widely used measure, the Robinson-Foulds metric. Working on the same set of taxa (or leaves), we want to know how many clades are present in exactly one of the two investigated trees. We discuss its advantages and disadvantages and generalize it to make it more applicable using more evolved cost functions. However, we still end up with a $\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem of finding a minimum cost arboreal matching between the sets of non-trivial clades.
