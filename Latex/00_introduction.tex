\chapter{Introduction}
Different areas of research have to compare trees at some point. Bioinformatics need a measure for comparing the similarities between different RNA-structures and computer scientists have to compare strucured text databases or natural languages. These are just three example of a wide range of real life applications of tree distances.\\
This thesis shall give a short overview of three widely used tree comparison techniques. It explains the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques. Furthermore we present an implementation of one of these techniques and discuss the results.
