\chapter{Comparing the Tree Edit Distance and the generalized Robinson Foulds Distance}
In this chapter we compare the results of our computations. The focus of this work was to find a possibility to resemble the gRF, which is quite time consuming, with a special case of the TED. We start by discussing the time complexity of both measures. Afterwards we discuss the differences between the distances themselves. We take a look whether we can simulate or improve the gRF by considering the TED with a certain distance function.

\section{Time Complexity}
We already talked about the time complexity of each distance measure a little bit in the previous two chapters. Our observations reflect the expected behaviour. Computing the TED was possible for trees with up to about 256 leaves each in a manageable time of approximately $520$ seconds. This was roughly the same time as it took to find the gRF of trees with $24$ leaves each.
